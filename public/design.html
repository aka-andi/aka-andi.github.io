        <p>I have been a part of organizations where I have had opportunities to create visual promotions. most of my
            designs featured here were created as th co-Design chair of kappa phi lambda sorority at gmu in spring 2020.

            I have also worked on a special gift for my grandmother, where I designed a collection of all her amazing
            fil-asian recipes into a cookbook to be printed. because these contain ~secret family recipes~, I have only
            included the first few pages to showcase my design.

            another pursuit of mine that is still in the works is creating a small sticker business. I'm one of those
            people who is obsessed with stickers, and I hope to share cute, uplifting, and funny designs with the world.
            these are some of the ideas I have worked on for a while now, and will be coming in sticker form soon! you
            can stay updated on when I will sell them on etsy by following my art instagram: @andiiuki</p></br>
